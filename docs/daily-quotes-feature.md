}
```

/>
```

### Categories

Additional categories can be added by modifying the API URL in `useQuotes.ts`.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Quote Not Loading
- **Check Network**: Ensure internet connection is available
- **API Status**: The Quotable API might be temporarily unavailable
- **Fallback**: System will automatically use fallback quotes

#### Same Quote Every Day
- **Clear Cache**: Clear browser localStorage to reset the quote cache
- **Manual Refresh**: Use the refresh button to get a new quote

#### Responsive Issues
- **Browser Support**: Ensure modern browser with CSS Grid support
- **Mobile Testing**: Test on various screen sizes

### Debug Information
The `useQuotes` hook provides error states that can be used for debugging:

```tsx
const { quote, loading, error, refreshQuote } = useQuotes();
console.log('Quote Error:', error); // Check for API issues
```

## Conclusion

The Daily Quote feature successfully integrates motivational content into the employee activity application, providing a small but meaningful enhancement to the user experience. The three-variant approach ensures the feature works well across different dashboard types while the robust caching and fallback systems ensure reliability.

This feature demonstrates how small UX improvements can contribute to a more engaging and inspiring work environment, supporting employee motivation and productivity goals.
